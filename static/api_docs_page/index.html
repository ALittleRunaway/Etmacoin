                        <p>Welcome to the API documentation! This is a part for the developers, miners and also
                            everyone who is curious. Blockchain is a completely open and decentralised technology,
                            which means that everyone including you can access all the transactions' data.</p>
                        <p>To do so, use the following url with the GET method:</p>
                        <p><font color="#7fffd4"><a href="http://164.90.238.31/api/all_transactions">
                            http://164.90.238.31/api/all_transactions</a></font></p>
                        <p>This will provide you with a json containing the all the important information about
                            the transactions ever made. And the most important is a transactions hash. The hash of
                            the transaction has to be equal to the field 'PrevHash' of a next transaction and start
                            with four 6'. With this on your hands you can simply validate the blockchain and decide whether it should
                            be trusted or not.</p>
                        <p>You can use this data for the personal use or in your applications if you are a developer.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                         <h1 class="small_h1_header">Mining</h1><br>

                    <div class="div_api_2_text">
                        <p>This part is for those who want to actually gain some ɆtmaCoin, or miners in other words.
                            Those people make the existing of a blockchain technology possible because the transaction
                            (block) is considered accepted to the chain only after mining. That's what miners do -
                            they are trying to find the number (Proof Of Work, PoW) which will make the hash of a new
                            transaction with that number in it to follow specific blockchain rules.</p>
                        <p>For now this rule for the ɆtmaCoin is four leading 6's. This is not a strong rule, but it
                            is ok for the demonstration purposes.</p>
                        <p>You should also keep in mind that the mining is currently unavailable but coming soon!
                            For now the server itself gets and mines every single transaction.</p>
                        <p>In the future you will have the url with the required data of the first unmined transaction
                            and another url with the POST method where you will send your mined PoW.</p>
